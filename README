The lab6_linux directory is a basic implementation of the lab 6 functionality
in which users can test their algoritms using input from a .txt file rather than
having to physically be in the ECE470 lab with the webcam.  This compiles with g++
and should function on all linux EWS machines.  This program is intended for students
to repurpose for their solutions in order to be able to work outside the lab.  The
algorithms contained in it are partially contained in our final solution.  

The lab6_submission directory is the submitted solution for labs 5+6.
